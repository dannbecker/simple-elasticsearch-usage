# elasticsearch-project
 
This small project consists of using a simple webscraping on G1 website, extracting the news last updated date and the body of the news. The library used to extraction is BeautifulSoap, wich collects information in HTML, and Elasticsearch as a NoSQL database to store and query data. Some queries where made in tests.py file, such as searching all news containing the word covid-19.
